## Optimization Techniques

### Rendering Performance
```javascript
// Optimized rendering with React
const OptimizedComponent = React.memo(({ data }) => {
  const visibleItems = useVirtualScroll(data);

  return (
    <div className="scroll-container">
      {visibleItems.map(item => (
        <MemoizedItem key={item.id} item={item} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
});
```

### Image Optimization
```javascript
// Responsive images with lazy loading
const ResponsiveImage = ({ src, alt, sizes }) => {
  return (
    <img
      src={src}
      srcSet={`${src}?w=400 400w, ${src}?w=800 800w, ${src}?w=1200 1200w`}
      sizes={sizes}
      alt={alt}
      loading="lazy"
      decoding="async"
    />
  );
};
```

### Code Splitting
```javascript
// Route-based code splitting
const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./Component'));

const App = () => (
  <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
      <Route path="/heavy" element={<LazyComponent />} />
    </Routes>
  </Suspense>
);
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Rendering Issues
- **Unnecessary Re-renders**: Use React.memo, useMemo, useCallback
- **Large Component Trees**: Split components, use lazy loading
- **Heavy Calculations**: Memoize expensive operations
- **Memory Leaks**: Clean up event listeners, intervals

### Loading Issues

## Optimization Strategies

### File Access Patterns
```javascript
// Efficient bulk reading
const bulkRead = async (filePaths) => {
  const promises = filePaths.map(path =>
    fs.promises.readFile(path, 'utf8')
  );
  return Promise.all(promises);
};

// Streaming for large files
const processLargeFile = (filePath) => {
  return fs.createReadStream(filePath)
    .pipe(transformStream)
    .pipe(fs.createWriteStream(outputPath));
};
```

### Caching Strategies
- **Memory Caching**: LRU cache, TTL-based expiration
- **Disk Caching**: Persistent cache, cache invalidation

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Performance Bottlenecks
